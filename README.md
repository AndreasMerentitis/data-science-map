# data_science_map

The goal of this project is to create a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms across domains and application areas. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all algorithms,
but it is intended to capture the most inconic, promising or widely used families of algorithms at this point in time (2018). Since the txonomy quickly becomes quite extended, Dynamic 
Node-Link Trees (D3) are used for adaptive visualization. The project has been tested with the Firefox web browser. A screenshot with two expended areas is given in the image below:
