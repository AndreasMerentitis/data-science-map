# data_science_map

The goal of this project is to create a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms across domains and application areas. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all algorithms,
but it is intended to capture the most inconic, promising or widely used families of algorithms at this point in time (2018). Since the taxonomy quickly becomes quite extended, Dynamic 
Node-Link Trees (D3) are used for adaptive visualization. In order to read the json file with the tree sructure you need to run a local server:

For python 2 you can open a local server in the folder of the d3 project like this: 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

For python 3 you can open a local server in the folder of the d3 project like this: 
python -m http.server 

The project has been tested with the Firefox web browser. A screenshot with two expended areas is given in the image below:
